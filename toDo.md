1. **Network**:
   - Implement Token-based authentication for the web and camera servers
   - Use HTTPS with proper certificates instead of plain HTTP
   - Create IPv6 only Mode

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Create a consistent error handling pattern across all modules
   - Use the thiserror crate to simplify error definitions
   - Add better context to errors with anyhow::Context

3. **Logging**:
   - Add structured logging with tracing crate
   - Set up different log levels for development vs. production
   - Log all security-relevant events

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Use serde for serialization/deserialization consistently
   - Validate configuration at startup with clear error messages
   - Support environment variable overrides for configuration

5. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Use RwLock where appropriate for read-heavy data
   - Implement proper cancellation for tasks during shutdown
   - Add timeouts to all network and I/O operations

6. **Performance**:
   - Batch database operations where possible
   - Use connection pooling with proper limits
   - Consider adaptive polling frequencies

7. **Security**:
   - Validate all inputs from web API
   - Add rate limiting to prevent DoS
   - Implement proper access control
   - Use secure defaults and fail closed

8. **Code Organization**:
   - Add comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
   - Improve and expand test coverage

9. **Resource Management**:
   - Implement graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
   - Add bounds on memory usage for buffers and caches

10. **Camera Stream**:
   - Use a more efficient protocol than SSE with base64-encoded frames
   - Consider WebRTC or similar technologies for real-time video
   - Implement proper reconnection handling
   - Optimize the camera stream with hardware acceleration

11. **Debugging and Crosscompiling**:
   - Build Dockerfile
   - Check Raspberry Pi settings
   - Build Binary

12. **Assembly**:
   - Build missing sensor fixtures
   - Design PCB 
   - Finish power supply box
   - Wiring
   - Design Lid

13. **Testing**:
   - Test Run
   - Debugging
